hf_mtv
======

This is a wordpress project for a luxury car "portal", connecting sellers to dealers. It includes a bidding and alert system, and minor data scrubbing.

Of note is the fact that this uses the [Wordpress MTV plugin](https://github.com/newsapps/wordpress-mtv) which is wonderful as it approximates the MVC framework of Django. 

This uses Mustache templates instead of the default.

The meat of this is in `wp-content/themes/hitfigure`
